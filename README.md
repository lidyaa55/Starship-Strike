# Overview

In this project, I aimed to enhance my software development skills by creating a classic arcade-style game, **Starship Strike**. The game involves controlling a spaceship to defend against waves of alien invaders. The objective is to shoot down as many enemies as possible while avoiding letting them reach the bottom of the screen.

The game mechanics include moving the player-controlled spaceship left and right and shooting bullets at enemies. Each time an enemy is hit, it respawns in a random location. The game ends when any enemy successfully reaches the player's defense line (the bottom of the screen).

This project helped me develop skills in game logic, collision detection, object movement, and user input handling using PyGame, furthering my learning as a software engineer.

# Development Environment

The game was developed using:

- **PyGame** for the game framework.
- **Visual Studio Code** as the code editor.
- **Git** for version control.

# Future Work

There are several areas I plan to enhance in future iterations of the game:

- Add multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Implement sound effects and background music.
- Introduce different types of enemies with varied attack patterns.
- Add power-ups and special weapons for the player.
